We were tasked with learning Electron and building our first app with it over the course of a weekend.

For the docs on Electron please [click here](https://github.com/electron/electron).


First, we set up our repo and then ran the following in our command line: 

```sh
npm init

# Install as a development dependency
npm install electron --save-dev

# Install the `electron` command globally in your $PATH
npm install electron -g
```install electron -g
```
